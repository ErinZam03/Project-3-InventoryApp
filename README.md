# Project-3-InventoryApp
Summary of Requirements and Goals
The app was designed to address the need for a simple and efficient way to manage inventory items. It allows users to log in, add, edit, and delete items, as well as view a list of their inventory in a user-friendly interface. The goal was to create a mobile app that is intuitive, functional, and responsive to user needs, while maintaining a clean and organized design.

Screens and Features
The app includes several key screens and features to meet user needs:

Login Screen: Allows users to securely log in or register for an account.
Inventory Management Screen: Displays inventory items in a grid format with options to add, edit, and delete items.
Add Item Screen: Provides a form for adding new items, including their name, category, and quantity.
Edit/Delete Feature: Enables users to update item details or remove items.
The UI was designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, using consistent layouts and clear labels. By keeping the design straightforward, it ensures users can quickly navigate and complete tasks.

Approach to Coding
The coding process focused on modularity and user-centered design principles. I started by building a database structure using SQLite to store user and inventory data. Features were implemented incrementally, testing each one before moving to the next. Using reusable components like adapters for the RecyclerView helped streamline the process. These strategies can be applied to future projects to ensure maintainable and scalable code.

Testing Process
I tested the app using the Android Emulator to verify the functionality of each feature, including login validation, database operations, and UI interactions. Regular testing helped identify and fix bugs early, ensuring the app met user expectations. This process revealed the importance of thorough testing in delivering a reliable application.

Challenges and Innovations
One significant challenge was integrating the SMS notification feature, which required careful handling of user permissions. To overcome this, I implemented runtime permission requests and tested multiple scenarios to ensure the app worked even if permissions were denied. This taught me the value of flexibility in app functionality.

Demonstrated Knowledge and Skills
The app demonstrates my ability to build a functional, user-centered mobile application using Android Studio. I am particularly proud of the database integration and UI design, which effectively combine functionality and user-friendliness.
